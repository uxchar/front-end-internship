# JS Activity 4 - Loops

## ðŸ“‹ Instructions

1. Create a loop that runs from 0 to 9.

2. Create a loop that runs from 9 to 0.
   
3. Create a while loop that runs as long as i is less than 10.
   
4. Create a while loop that runs as long as i is less than 100,  but increases i by 2 each time.
   
5. Using the example below, Create a loop from 1  to 20 that will print out if that number is odd or even.
   
   Look at the following code that shows even numbers (even numbers are divisible by 2) between 1 and 10.

    ```
    for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        if (i % 2 === 0) {
        console.log(`${i} is even`);
      }
    }
    ```

    This program uses the modulo operator %, which calculates the remainder after division of one number by another.
    For example:

    ```
    console.log(10 % 2); // 0 because 10 = 5 * 2 + 0
    console.log(11 % 2); // 1 because 11 = 5 * 2 + 1
    console.log(18 % 3); // 0 because 18 = 3 * 6 + 0
    console.log(19 % 3); // 1 because 19 = 3 * 6 + 1
    console.log(20 % 3); // 2 because 20 = 3 * 6 + 2
    ```
