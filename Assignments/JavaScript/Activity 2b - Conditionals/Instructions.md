# JS Activity 2b - More Conditionals

## ðŸ“‹ Instructions

```
const isTrue = false
```
1. Make a conditional that tells if the above variable is `true` or `false`. Log the result to the console.

```
const option1 = true
const option2 = false
```
2. Create a conditional that checks if `option1` and `option2` are true. If they are console log they're true. If they are both false log they are false. If one is true and the other is false log one of them is true.

1. Create a radio button called `click me`. Create a function that can tell if the radio button has been clicked or not.

2. Create a text box that asks a user to guess a color. If the color they type in is red make an alert that says "You got it!"
