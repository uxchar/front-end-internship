# JS Activity 11 - Functions

## ðŸ“‹ Instructions

1. Write a function that multiplies a number by 2 and divides it by 3

2. Write the function from #1 as a fat arrow function

3. Write a function that takes a name, age, and height and writes a console log using all of them

4. Write two functions, `add(a, b)` and `multiply(a, b)` that each take two variables and returns the summed or multiplied value

BONUS: Write a function that uses the functions from #4 (add and multiply) to take a value and adds 2 and multiplies by 4. So, `addTwoMultiplyByFour(2)` would return `16` since `((2 + 2) x 4)`
