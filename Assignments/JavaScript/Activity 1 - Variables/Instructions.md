# JS Activity 1 - Variables

## ðŸ“‹ Instructions

Create and save a
javascript file in VSCode to complete the following activity. (Mark the activity questions
as a comment preceding your solution)

1. Write an improved version of hello world that says
   `hello {firstName} {lastName}`
   
2. Display the sum of `5 + 10`, using two variables: `x` and
`y`.

3. Create a variable called `z`, assign `x + y` to it, and log
the result.

4. Write a program that takes a temperature in Celsius
degrees, then logs it in Fahrenheit degrees. The conversion formula is `[Â°F] =
[Â°C] x 9/5 + 32`.

5. Look at the following code and try to predict the final
values of its variables. Run the code to see if you were correct

```
    let a = 2;
    a -= 1;
    a++;
    let b = 8;
    b += 2;
    const c = a + b * b;
    const d = a * b + b;
    const e = a * (b + b);
    const f = a * b / a;
    const g = b / a * a;
    console.log(a, b, c, d, e, f, g);
```

6. Bonus: Swap the values of the 2 variables below without creating any new variables.

```
    let firstNumber = 4;
    let secondNumber = 9;
```
