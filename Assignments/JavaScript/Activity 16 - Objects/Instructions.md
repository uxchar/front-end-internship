# JS Activity 16 - Objects

## ðŸ“‹ Instructions

1. Create a dog object that has the properties `height`, `breed`, `weight`, and a method called bark that logs `"Woof"` to the console.

2. Create a house object that has properties `squareFootage`, `numberOfBedrooms`, and `numberOfBathrooms`. Log these three properties to the console. 

3. Write a program that creates an account object with the following characteristics:
    - A `name` property set to "Alex".
    - A `balance` property set to 0.
    - A `credit` method that adds the value passed as an argument to the account balance.
    - A `debit` method that subtracts the value passed as an argument from the account balance.
    - A `describe` method that logs the account balance
  
    Use this object to log its balance, crediting 250, debiting 80, then log its balance again.
