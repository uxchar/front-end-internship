# JS Activity 21 - JSON/Web Request Cat Facts

## ðŸ“‹ Instructions

Create a webpage that adds cat fact cards!  The idea is fairly simple just have a webpage with a button and when ever you click the button it generates a new card with a cat image and a random cat fact.  Image below for reference.
